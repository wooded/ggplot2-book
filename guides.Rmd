# Guides: legends and axes {#guides}
\index{Guides} \index{Legend} \index{Axis}

In Chapter \@ref(scales) I discussed the way a scale maps a variable to an aesthetic. This chapter is a natural continuation, discussing the role scales play in controlling the __guide__, the axis or legend associated with the scale. You might find it surprising that axes and legends are the same type of thing, but while they look very different they have the same purpose: to allow you to read observations from the plot and map them back to their original values. 

In ggplot2, guides are produced automatically based on the layers in your plot. You don't directly control the legends and axes; instead you set up the data so that there's a clear mapping between data and aesthetics, and a guide is generated for you. This is very different to base R graphics, where you have total control over the legend, and can be frustrating when you first start using ggplot2. However, once you get the hang of it, you'll find that it saves you time, and there is little you cannot do.

The early sections of this chapter highlight functionality that is shared by axes and legends. Section \@ref(scale-name) discusses the `name` argument, while Section \@ref(scale-breaks) covers `breaks` and Section \@ref(scale-labels) discusses `labels`. 

| Argument name   | Axis              | Legend        
|:----------------|:------------------|:--------------
| `name`          | Label             | Title         
| `breaks`        | Ticks & grid line | Key           
| `labels`        | Tick label        | Key label     

```{r guides, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Common components of axes and legends"}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/scale-guides.png", dpi = 300, auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Later parts of the chapter focuses mostly on legends because they are more complicated than axes:

1.  A legend can display multiple aesthetics (e.g. colour and shape), from
    multiple layers, and the symbol displayed in a legend varies based on the
    geom used in the layer.
   
1.  Axes always appear in the same place. Legends can appear in different 
    places, so you need some global way of controlling them.
  
1.  Legends have considerably more details that can be tweaked: should they
    be displayed vertically or horizontally? How many columns? How big should
    the keys be?
    
Reflecting this additional complexity, Section \@ref(scale-guide) discusses guide functions, most of which relate to legends. Section \@ref(legend-merge-split) discusses how legends are split and merged across layers, Section \@ref(legend-layout) focuses on legend layout and positioning, while Section \@ref(legend-glyph) shows you how to modify the glyphs displayed in the legend key.

## Scale names {#scale-name}

A common task when creating plots is to customise the title of the axes and legends. To illustrate how this is done, I'll create a small  `toy` data frame that I will reuse throughout the chapter:
    
```{r}
toy <- data.frame(
  const = 1, 
  up = 1:4,
  txt = letters[1:4], 
  big = (1:4)*1000,
  log = c(2, 5, 10, 2000)
)
toy
```

The axis or legend title is specified by `name`, which is always the first argument to the scale function. Usually this argument takes a text string as input, using `\n` to specify line breaks, but you can supply mathematical expressions wrapped `quote()`, as described in `?plotmath`
\index{Axis!title} \index{Legend!title}
    
`r columns(2, 1 / 2)`
```{r guide-names}
base <- ggplot(toy, aes(up, up)) + geom_point()

base + scale_x_continuous("X axis")
base + scale_x_continuous(quote(a + mathematical ^ expression))
```

It is also possible to include (some) markdown in axis and legend titles with the help of the ggtext package [@ggtext] and the ggplot2 theme system (see Chapter \@ref(polishing)). To enable markdown you need to set the relevant theme element to `ggtext::element_markdown()`, as demonstrated below:

`r columns(2, 1 / 2)`
```{r markdown-with-ggtext}
base <- ggplot(toy, aes(up, up)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous("Axis title with *italics* and **boldface**")

base
base + theme(axis.title.x = ggtext::element_markdown())
```

Because tweaking axis and legend labels is such a common task, ggplot2 provides the `labs()` helper function that saves you some typing. It allows you to set the name for one or more scales, using name-value pairs like `x = "X axis"` or `fill = "fill legend"`. It also allows you to specify other plot labels, like titles, subtitles, captions and tags (see Section \@ref(titles)):

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r guide-names-helper}
ggplot(toy, aes(const, up)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = txt)) + 
  labs(
    x = "X axis", 
    y = quote(Y^axis), 
    colour = "Colour\nlegend",
    title = "A pithy title",
    subtitle = "A more precise subtitle"
  )
```

There are two ways to remove the axis label. Setting `labs(x = "")` omits the label but still allocates space; setting `labs(x = NULL)` removes the label and its space. 

## Scale breaks {#scale-breaks}

In the same way that the `name` argument to a scale function governs axis titles and legend titles, the `breaks` argument controls which values appear as tick marks on axes and as keys on legends. 
\index{Axis!ticks} \index{Axis!breaks}

`r columns(2, 2 / 3)`
```{r breaks-labels}
axs <- ggplot(toy, aes(big, const)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

axs
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000))
```

The examples below illustrate the same ideas applied to legends:

```{r}
leg <- ggplot(toy, aes(up, up, fill = big)) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) 

leg 
leg + scale_fill_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000))
```

### Break functions {#break-functions}

In the examples above, I specified breaks manually, but ggplot2 also allows you to pass a function to `breaks`. This function should have one argument that specifies the limits of the scale (a numeric vector of length two), and it should return a numeric vector of breaks. You can write your own break function, but in many cases there is no need, thanks to the scales package [@scales]. It provides several tools that are useful for this purpose:

* `scales::breaks_extended()`	creates automatic breaks for numeric axes.
* `scales::breaks_log()`	creates breaks appropriate for log axes.
* `scales::breaks_pretty()`	creates "pretty" breaks for date/times.
* `scales::breaks_width()`	creates equally spaced breaks.

The `breaks_extended()` function is the standard method used in ggplot2, and accordingly the first two plots below are the same. I can alter the desired number of breaks by setting `n = 2`, as illustrated in the third plot. Note that `breaks_extended()` treats `n` as a suggestion rather than a strict constraint. If you need to specify exact breaks it is better to do so manually.  

`r columns(3, 1/2)`
```{r}
axs
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_extended())
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_extended(n = 2))
```

Another approach that is sometimes useful is specifying a fixed `width` that defines the spacing between breaks. The `breaks_width()` function is used for this. The first example below shows how to fix the width at a specific value; the second example illustrates the use of the `offset` argument that shifts all the breaks by a specified amount:

`r columns(3, 1/2)`
```{r}
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_width(800))
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_width(800, offset = 200))
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_width(800, offset = -200))
```

Notice the difference between setting an offset of 200 and -200.

### Date scale breaks {#date-scales}
\index{Date/times} \index{Data!date/time} \index{Time} \index{Scales!date/time} \indexf{scale\_x\_datetime}

A special case arises when an aesthetic is mapped to a date/time type: such as the base `Date` (for dates) and `POSIXct` (for date-times) classes, as well as the `hms` class for "time of day" values provided by the hms package [@hms]. If your dates are in a different format you will need to convert them using `as.Date()`, `as.POSIXct()` or `hms::as_hms()`. You may also find the lubridate package helpful to manipulate date/time data [@lubridate]. 

Assuming you have appropriately formatted data mapped to the x aesthetic, ggplot2 will use `scale_x_date()` as the default scale for dates and `scale_x_datetime()` as the default scale for date-time data. The corresponding scales for other aesthetics follow the usual naming rules. Date scales behave similarly to other continuous scales, but contain additional arguments that are allow you to work in date-friendly units. This section discusses breaks: controlling the labels for date scales is discussed in Section \@ref(date-labels).

The `date_breaks` argument allows you to position breaks by date units (years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds). For example, `date_breaks = "2 weeks"` will place a major tick mark every two weeks and `date_breaks = 25 years"` will place them every 25 years:

`r columns(2, 1 / 2)`
```{r date-scale}
date_base <- ggplot(economics, aes(date, psavert)) + 
  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

date_base 
date_base + scale_x_date(date_breaks = "25 years")
```

It may be useful to note that internally `date_breaks = "25 years"` is treated as a shortcut for `breaks = scales::breaks_width("25 years")`. The longer form is typically unnecessary, but it can be useful if---as discussed in Section \@ref(break-functions)---you wish to specify an `offset`. Suppose the goal is to plot data that span the 20th century, beginning 1 January 1900, and we wish to set breaks in 25 year intervals. Specifying `date_breaks = "25 years"` produces breaks in the following fashion:

```{r}
century20 <- as.Date(c("1900-01-01", "1999-12-31"))
breaks <- scales::breaks_width("25 years")
breaks(century20)
```

Because the range in `century20` starts on 1 January and the breaks increment in whole year values, each of the generated break dates falls on 1 January. We can shift all these breaks so that they fall on 1 February by setting `offset = 31` (since there are thirty one days in January).

### Suppressing breaks

<!-- DN: I like this as a distinct section! -->

You can suppress the breaks entirely by setting them to `NULL`. For axes, this removes the tick marks, grid lines, and labels; and for legends this this removes the keys and labels.

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL)
leg + scale_fill_continuous(breaks = NULL)
```

### Minor breaks {#minor-breaks}
\index{Minor breaks}\index{Log!ticks}

You can adjust the minor breaks (the unlabelled faint grid lines that appear between the major grid lines) by supplying a numeric vector of positions to the `minor_breaks` argument. 

Minor breaks are particularly useful for log scales because they give a clear visual indicator that the scale is non-linear. To show them off, I'll first create a vector of minor break values (on the transformed scale), using `%o%` to quickly generate a multiplication table and `as.numeric()` to flatten the table to a vector.

```{r}
mb <- unique(as.numeric(1:10 %o% 10 ^ (0:3)))
mb
```

The following plots illustrate the effect of setting the minor breaks:
`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
log_base <- ggplot(toy, aes(log, const)) + geom_point()

log_base + scale_x_log10()
log_base + scale_x_log10(minor_breaks = mb)
```

As with `breaks`, you can also supply a function to `minor_breaks`, such as `scales::minor_breaks_n()` or `scales::minor_breaks_width()` functions that can be helpful in controlling the minor breaks.

For date/time scales, you can use the `date_minor_breaks` argument:

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r date-scale-2}
date_base + scale_x_date(
  limits = as.Date(c("2003-01-01", "2003-04-01")),
  date_breaks = "1 month"
)

date_base + scale_x_date(
  limits = as.Date(c("2003-01-01", "2003-04-01")),
  date_breaks = "1 month",
  date_minor_breaks = "1 week"
)
```

Note that in the first plot, the minor breaks are spaced evenly between the monthly major breaks. In the second plot, the major and minor beaks follow slightly different patterns: the minor breaks are always spaced 7 days apart but the major breaks are 1 month apart. Because the months vary in length, this leads to slightly uneven spacing.

## Scale labels {#scale-labels}
\index{Axis!labels} \index{Legend!keys}

Every break is associated with a label and these can be changed by setting the `labels` argument to the scale function:

```{r}
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000), labels = c("2k", "4k"))
leg + scale_fill_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000), labels = c("2k", "4k"))
```

When the data are categorical, you also have the option of using a named vector to set the labels associated with particular values. This allows you to change some labels and not others, without altering the ordering or the breaks:

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(toy, aes(const, txt)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

base
base + scale_y_discrete(labels = c(c = "carrot", b = "banana"))
```

### Label functions {#label-functions}

In the examples above I specified the vector of `labels` manually, but ggplot2 also allows you to pass a labelling function. A function passed to `labels` should accept a numeric vector of breaks as input and return a character vector of labels (the same length as the input). The scales package provides a number of tools that will automatically construct label functions for you. Some of the more useful examples for numeric data include:

* `scales::label_bytes()` formats numbers as kilobytes, megabytes etc.
* `scales::label_comma()` formats numbers as decimals with coomas added.
* `scales::label_dollar()` formats numbers as currency.
* `scales::label_ordinal()` formats numbers in rank order: 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.
* `scales::label_percent()` formats numbers as percentages.
* `scales::label_pvalue()` formats numbers as p-values: <.05, <.01, .34, etc.

The also contains functions relevant for other kinds of data, such as `scales::label_wrap()` which allows you to wrap long strings across lines. 

A few examples are shown below to illustrate how these functions are used:

`r columns(3)`
```{r breaks-functions}
axs + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent())
axs + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar(prefix = "", suffix = "€"))
leg + scale_fill_continuous(labels = scales::label_bytes())
```

See the documentation of the scales package for more detail.

### Date scale labels {#date-labels}

Like `date_breaks`, date scales include a `date_labels` argument. It controls the display of the labels using the same formatting strings as in `strptime()` and `format()`. To display dates like 14/10/1979, for example, you would use the  string `"%d/%m/%Y"`: in this expression `%d` produces a numeric day of month, `%m` produces a numeric month, and `%Y` produces a four digit year. The table below provides a list of formatting strings:

| String        | Meaning
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------
| `%S`          | second (00-59)
| `%M`          | minute (00-59)
| `%l`          | hour, in 12-hour clock (1-12)
| `%I`          | hour, in 12-hour clock (01-12)
| `%p`          | am/pm
| `%H`          | hour, in 24-hour clock (00-23)
| `%a`          | day of week, abbreviated (Mon-Sun)
| `%A`          | day of week, full (Monday-Sunday)
| `%e`          | day of month (1-31)
| `%d`          | day of month (01-31)
| `%m`          | month, numeric (01-12)
| `%b`          | month, abbreviated (Jan-Dec)
| `%B`          | month, full (January-December)
| `%y`          | year, without century (00-99)
| `%Y`          | year, with century (0000-9999)


One useful scenario for date label formatting is when there's insufficient room to specify a four digit year. Using `%y` ensures that only the last two digits are displayed:

`r columns(2, 1 / 2)`
```{r date-scale-3}
base <- ggplot(economics, aes(date, psavert)) + 
  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

base + scale_x_date(date_breaks = "5 years")
base + scale_x_date(date_breaks = "5 years", date_labels = "%y")
```

It can be useful to include the line break character `\n` in a formatting string, particularly when full-length month names are included:

```{r date-scale-4}
lim <- as.Date(c("2004-01-01", "2005-01-01"))

base + scale_x_date(limits = lim, date_labels = "%b %y")
base + scale_x_date(limits = lim, date_labels = "%B\n%Y")
```

In these examples I have specified the labels manually via the `date_labels` argument. An alternative approach is to pass a labelling function to the `labels` argument, in the same way I described in Section \@ref(label-functions). The scales package provides two convenient functions that will generate date labellers for you:

* `label_date()` is what `date_labels` does for you behind the scenes, so you
  rarely need to call it directly.

* `label_date_short()` automatically constructs short labels that are 
  sufficient to uniquely identify the dates: 

    ```{r date-scale-5}
    base + scale_x_date(labels = scales::label_date("%b %y"))
    base + scale_x_date(limits = lim, labels = scales::label_date_short())
    ```

### Suppressing labels

You can suppress labels with `labels = NULL`. This will remove the labels from the axis or legend while leaving its other properties unchanged:

```{r}
axs + scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL)
leg + scale_fill_continuous(labels = NULL)
```


### Exercises

1.  Recreate the following graphic:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
      geom_point() +  
      scale_x_continuous("Displacement", labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = "L")) + 
      scale_y_continuous(quote(paste("Highway ", (frac(miles, gallon))))) 
    ```
    
    Adjust the y axis label so that the parentheses are the right size.

1.  List the three different types of object you can supply to the
    `breaks` argument. How do `breaks` and `labels` differ?
    
1.  Recreate the following plot:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    drv_labels <- c("4" = "4wd", "f" = "fwd", "r" = "rwd")
    ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
      geom_point(aes(colour = drv)) +  
      scale_colour_discrete(labels = drv_labels)
    ```

1.  What label function allows you to create mathematical expressions?
    What label function converts 1 to 1st, 2 to 2nd, and so on?
    
1.  What are the three most important arguments that apply to both 
    axes and legends? What do they do? Compare and contrast their
    operation for axes vs. legends.



## Scale guides {#scale-guide}

Another way to modify the behaviour of axes and legends is with the `guide` argument of the relevant scale function or---perhaps more conveniently---the `guides()` helper function. The `guides()` helper works in a similar way to the `labs()` helper function described in Section \@ref(scale-name). Both take the name of different aesthetics (e.g., color, x, fill) as arguments and allow you to specify your own value. Where `labs()` provides a shorthand way to specify the `name` argument to one or more scales, the `guides()` function allows you to specify `guide` arguments to one or more scales. In the same way that `labs(colour = "a colour scale name")` specifies the name associated with the colour scale, a command such as `guides(colour = guide_coloursteps())` can be used to specify its associated guide:

`r columns(3)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = cyl)) + geom_point()

base 
base + scale_colour_continuous(guide = guide_coloursteps())
base + guides(colour = guide_coloursteps())
```

Scale guides are more complex than scale names: where the `name` argument (and `labs()` ) takes text as input, the `guide` argument (and `guides()`) require a guide object created by a **guide function** such as `guide_colourbar()` and `guide_legend()`. These arguments to these functions offer additional fine control over the guide. 

The table below summarises the default guide functions associated with different scale types:


| Scale type                                           | Default guide type  |       
|:-----------------------------------------------------|:--------------------|
| continuous scales for colour/fill aesthetics         | colourbar           |
| binned scales for colour/fill aesthetics             | coloursteps         |
| position scales (continuous, binned and discrete)    | axis                |
| discrete scales (except position scales)             | legend              |
| binned scales (except position/colour/fill scales)   | bins                |

The guide functions have numerous examples in the documentation that illustrate all of their arguments. Many of the arguments to the guide function are equivalent to theme settings (Chapter \@ref(polishing)) like text colour, size, font etc, but only apply to a single guide. Here I'll focus on the non-theming arguments.

### `guide_legend()`

The legend guide displays individual keys in a table. The most useful options are: \index{Legend!guide}

*   `nrow` or `ncol` which specify the dimensions of the table. `byrow` 
    controls how the table is filled: `FALSE` fills it by column (the default),
    `TRUE` fills it by row.

    `r columns(3)`
    ```{r legend-rows-cols}
    base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, fill = factor(cyl))) + geom_bar() 

    base
    base + guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2))
    base + guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE))
    ```

*   `reverse` reverses the order of the keys:
    
    ```{r}
    base
    base + guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))
    ```

*   `override.aes` is useful when you want the elements in the legend 
    display differently to the geoms in the plot. This is often required
    when you've used transparency or size to deal with moderate overplotting
    and also used colour in the plot. \indexf{override.aes}

    `r columns(2, 2/3)`
    ```{r}
    base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = drv)) +
      geom_point(size = 4, alpha = .2, stroke = 0)
    
    base + guides(colour = guide_legend())
    base + guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))
    ```


*   `keywidth` and `keyheight` (along with `default.unit`) allow you to specify
    the size of the keys. These are grid units, e.g. `unit(1, "cm")`.

### `guide_bins()`

`guide_bins()` is suited to the situation when a continuous variable is binned and then mapped to an aesthetic that produces a legend, such as size, colour and fill. For instance, in the `mpg` data we could use `scale_size_binned()` to create a binned version of the continuous variable `hwy`. 

`r columns(2, 1)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, manufacturer, size = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  scale_size_binned()
```

Unlike `guide_legend()`, the guide created for a binned scale by `guide_bins()` does not organise the individual keys into a table. Instead they are arranged in a column (or row) along a single vertical (or horizontal) axis, which by default is displayed with its own axis. The important arguments to `guide_bins()` are listed below:

*   `axis` indicates whether the axis should be drawn (default is `TRUE`).

    ```{r}
    base
    base + guides(size = guide_bins(axis = FALSE))
    ```

*   `direction` is a character string specifying the direction of the guide:

    ```{r}
    base + guides(size = guide_bins(direction = "vertical"))
    base + guides(size = guide_bins(direction = "horizontal"))
    ```

*   `show.limits` specifies whether tick marks are shown at the ends of the 
    guide axis

*   `axis.colour`, `axis.linewidth` and `axis.arrow` are used to
    control the guide axis that is displayed alongside the legend keys 

    ```{r}
    base + guides(size = guide_bins(show.limits = TRUE))
    base + guides(
      size = guide_bins(
        axis.colour = "red",
        axis.arrow = arrow(
          length = unit(.1, "inches"), 
          ends = "first", 
          type = "closed"
        )
      )
    )
    ```

*   `keywidth`, `keyheight`, `reverse` and `override.aes` have the same
  behaviour as `guide_legend()` 

### `guide_colourbar()` / `guide_colorbar()`

The colour bar guide is designed for continuous ranges of colors---as its name implies, it outputs a rectangle over which the color gradient varies.  The most important arguments are: \index{Legend!colour bar} \index{Colour bar}

* `barwidth` and `barheight` allow you to specify the size of the bar. 
  These are grid units, e.g. `unit(1, "cm")`.
  
* `nbin` controls the number of slices. You may want to increase this from
  the default value of 20 if you draw a very long bar.

* `reverse` flips the colour bar to put the lowest values at the top.

These options are illustrated below:

`r columns(3)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cyl, displ, colour = hwy)) +
  geom_point(size = 2)

base
base + guides(colour = guide_colourbar(reverse = TRUE))
base + guides(colour = guide_colourbar(barheight = unit(2, "cm")))
```

### `guide_coloursteps()` / `guide_colorsteps()`

This "colour steps" guide is a version of `guide_colourbar()` appropriate for binned colour and fill scales. It shows the area between breaks as a single constant colour, rather than displaying a colour gradient that varies smoothly along the bar. Arguments mostly mirror those for `guide_colourbar()`. The additional arguments are as follows:

*   `show.limits` indicates whether values should be shown at the ends of the stepped colour bar (analogous to the corresponding argument in `guide_bins()`)

    `r columns(2)`
    ```{r}
    base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = cyl)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      scale_color_binned()

    base + guides(colour = guide_coloursteps(show.limits = TRUE))
    base + guides(colour = guide_coloursteps(show.limits = FALSE))
    ```

*   `ticks` is a logical variable indicating whether tick marks should be displayed adjacent to the legend labels (default is `NULL`, in which case the value is inherited from the scale)

*   `even.steps` is a logical variable indicating whether bins should be evenly spaced (default is `TRUE`) or proportional in size to their frequency in the data



### `guide_axis()`

Guide functions exist mostly to control plot legends, but---as legends and axes are both kinds of guide---ggplot2 also supplies a `guide_axis()` function for axes. Its main purpose is to provide additional controls that prevent labels from overlapping:

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(manufacturer, hwy)) + geom_boxplot() 

base + guides(x = guide_axis(n.dodge = 3))
base + guides(x = guide_axis(angle = 90))
```

### `guide_none()`

The final guide function is `guide_none()`, in which no guide is drawn for the relevant aesthetic.


## Legend merging and splitting {#legend-merge-split}

There is always a one-to-one correspondence between position scales and axes. But the connection between non-position scales and legend is more complex: one legend may need to draw symbols from multiple layers ("merging"), or one aesthetic may need multiple legends ("splitting").

### Merging legends {#sub-layers-legends}
\index{Legend}

Merging legends occurs quite frequently when using ggplot2. For example, if you've mapped colour to both points and lines, the keys will show both points and lines. If you've mapped fill colour, you get a rectangle. Note the way the legend varies in the plots below:

`r columns(3)`
```{r legend-geom, echo = FALSE}
base <- ggplot(toy, aes(const, up, colour = txt))
base + geom_point()
base + geom_point() + geom_path(aes(group = 1))
base + geom_raster(aes(fill = txt))
```

By default, a layer will only appear if the corresponding aesthetic is mapped to a variable with `aes()`. You can override whether or not a layer appears in the legend with `show.legend`: `FALSE` to prevent a layer from ever appearing in the legend; `TRUE` forces it to appear when it otherwise wouldn't. Using `TRUE` can be useful in conjunction with the following trick to make points stand out:

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
ggplot(toy, aes(up, up)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, colour = "grey20") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = txt), size = 2) 

ggplot(toy, aes(up, up)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, colour = "grey20", show.legend = TRUE) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = txt), size = 2) 
```

ggplot2 tries to use the fewest number of legends to accurately convey the aesthetics used in the plot. It does this by combining legends where the same variable is mapped to different aesthetics. The figure below shows how this works for points: if both colour and shape are mapped to the same variable, then only a single legend is necessary. \index{Legend!merging}

`r columns(3)`
```{r legend-merge}
base <- ggplot(toy, aes(const, up)) +
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL)
base + geom_point(aes(colour = txt))
base + geom_point(aes(shape = txt))
base + geom_point(aes(shape = txt, colour = txt))
```

In order for legends to be merged, they must have the same `name`. So if you change the name of one of the scales, you'll need to change it for all of them. One way to do this is by using `labs()` helper function:

`r columns(3, 3/2)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(toy, aes(const, up)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = txt, colour = txt)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL)

base
base + labs(shape = "Split legend")
base + labs(shape = "Merged legend", colour = "Merged legend")
```


### Splitting legends

Splitting a legend is a much less common data visualisation task. In general it is not advisable to map one aesthetic (e.g. colour) to multiple variables, and so by default ggplot2 does not allow you to "split" the colour aesthetic into multiple scales with separate legends. Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this general rule, and it is possible to override this behaviour using the ggnewscale package [@ggnewscale]. The `ggnewscale::new_scale_colour()` command acts as an instruction to ggplot2 to initialise a new colour scale: scale and guide commands that appear above the `new_scale_colour()` command will be applied to the first colour scale, and commands that appear below are applied to the second colour scale. 

To illustrate this the plot on the left uses `geom_point()` to display a large marker for each vehicle make in the `mpg` data, with a single colour scale that maps to the year. On the right, a second `geom_point()` layer is overlaid on the plot using small markers: this layer is associated with a different colour scale, used to indicate whether the vehicle has a 4-cylinder engine.

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = factor(year)), size = 5) + 
  scale_colour_brewer("year", type = "qual", palette = 5) 

base
base + 
  ggnewscale::new_scale_colour() + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = cyl == 4), size = 1, fill = NA) + 
  scale_colour_manual("4 cylinder", values = c("grey60", "black"))
```

Additional details, including functions that apply to other scale types, are available on the package website, <https://github.com/eliocamp/ggnewscale>.

## Legend positioning {#legend-layout}

A number of settings that affect the overall display of the legends are controlled through the theme system. You'll learn more about that in Section \@ref(themes), but for now, all you need to know is that you modify theme settings with the `theme()` function. \index{Themes!legend} 

The position and justification of legends are controlled by the theme setting `legend.position`, which takes values "right", "left", "top", "bottom", or "none" (no legend). \index{Legend!layout}

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r legend-position}
base <- ggplot(toy, aes(up, up)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = txt), size = 3) + 
  xlab(NULL) + 
  ylab(NULL)

base + theme(legend.position = "left")
base + theme(legend.position = "right") # the default 
base + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
base + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Switching between left/right and top/bottom modifies how the keys in each legend are laid out (horizontal or vertically), and how multiple legends are stacked (horizontal or vertically). If needed, you can adjust those options independently:

* `legend.direction`: layout of items in legends ("horizontal" or "vertical").

* `legend.box`: arrangement of multiple legends ("horizontal" or "vertical").

* `legend.box.just`: justification of each legend within the overall bounding 
   box, when there are multiple legends ("top", "bottom", "left", or "right").

Alternatively, if there's a lot of blank space in your plot you might want to place the legend inside the plot. You can do this by setting `legend.position` to a numeric vector of length two. The numbers represent a relative location in the panel area: `c(0, 1)` is the top-left corner and `c(1, 0)` is the bottom-right corner. You control which corner of the legend the `legend.position` refers to with `legend.justification`, which is specified in a similar way. Unfortunately positioning the legend exactly where you want it requires a lot of trial and error.

`r columns(3, 1.5)`
```{r legend-position-man}
base <- ggplot(toy, aes(up, up)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = txt), size = 3)

base + theme(legend.position = c(0, 1), legend.justification = c(0, 1))
base + theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 0.5), legend.justification = c(0.5, 0.5))
base + theme(legend.position = c(1, 0), legend.justification = c(1, 0))
```

There's also a margin around the legends, which you can suppress with `legend.margin = unit(0, "mm")`.

## Legend key glyphs {#legend-glyph}

In most cases the default glyphs shown in the legend key will be appropriate to the layer and the aesthetic. Line plots of different colours will show up as lines of different colours in the legend, boxplots will appear as small boxplots in the legend, and so on. Should you need to override this behaviour, the `key_glyph` argument can be used to associate a particular layer with a different kind of glyph. For example:

`r columns(2, 1/2)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(economics, aes(date, psavert, color = "savings"))

base + geom_line()
base + geom_line(key_glyph = "timeseries")
```

More precisely, each geom is associated with a function such as `draw_key_path()`, `draw_key_boxplot()` or `draw_key_path()` which is responsible for drawing the key when the legend is created. You can pass the desired key drawing function directly: for example, `base + geom_line(key_glyph = draw_key_timeseries)` would also produce the plot shown above right.
